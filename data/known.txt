there

in

not

infrequently

of

deferred

he

will

find

there

also

a

tolerably

full

account

of

of

human

and

of

human

cupidity

faulty

methods

of

are

followed

wrecks

as

many

therapeutists

to-day

as

it

ever

did

notwithstanding

its

fallacies

have

been

demonstrated

so

often

as

to

make

mention

of

the

subject

distressing

it

might

be

expected

that

half

educated

physicians

without

preliminary

scientific

training

would

fall

into

this

error

but

when

some

of

the

brightest

men

in

the

professionmen

who

have

presumably

travelled

the

paths

of

logic

and

induction

all

their

lives

go

the

same

way

it

shows

pretty

plainly

what

must

be

the

inherent

difficulties

of

the

subject

and

that

for

the

proper

discussion

of

therapeutic

questions

no

caution

can

be

quite

great

enough

and

no

learning

quite

profound

enough

the

list

of

dead

theories

and

abandoned

remedies

grows

longer

each

year

and

the

experience

of

the

past

is

as

little

heeded

in

the

medical

as

in

the

financial

world

acuteness

of

intellect

and

extent

of

education

can

it

seems

no

more

keep

a

man

straight

in

medicine

than

they

can

in

religion

or

politics

men

who

for

years

have

been

esteemed

well

balanced

authors

and

practitioners

become

a

little

crazy

on

some

one

therapeutic

measure

and



advocate

its

employment

in

all

sorts

of

unsuitable

cases

good

illustrations

of

this

form

of

mental

activity

may

be

found

in

the

literature

of

hydrotherapy

and

of

electricity

thus

it

has

been

stated

that

every

case

of

typhoid

fever

may

be

made

to

end

in

recovery

by

the

proper

use

of

cold

baths

and

yet

this

writer

knew

in

how

many

ways

the

disease

may

kill

the

patientsome

of

them

almost

accidental

in

their

nature

he

knew

that

perforation

has

occurred

many

days

after

the

disappearance

of

pyrexia

he

knew

that

in

some

fatal

cases

the

temperature

never

exceeded



occasionally

such

a

man

after

sowing

dogmatic

statements

broad

cast

for

a

few

years

becomes

insane

enough

to

be

confined

in

an

asylum

sometimes

advancing

age

with

its

mental

deterioration

is

the

evident

cause

sometimes

these

acts

are

the

work

of

advertising

schemers

but

generally

the

explanation

is

to

be

found

in

that

mental

substratum

which

permits

otherwise

sane

and

well

educated

persons

to

entertain

monstrous

opinions

concerning

the

most

ordinary

matters

the

best

work

in

therapeutics

is

now

carried

on

quietly

without

brass

bands

or

sensational

announcements

a

few

earnest

men

in

each

civilized

country

are

patiently

working

out

the

physiological

action

of

drugs

as

a

basis

for

a

more

rational

therapy

the

significance

of

much

of

this

work

is

not

always

manifest

on

superficial

examination

but

it

already

forms

an

important

part

of

our

working

knowledge

and

is

gradually

crowding

out

venerable

empiricism

which

has

heretofore

occupied

so

prominent

a

place

in

medical

practice

whether

regular

or

irregular

manufacturing

chemists

no

one

will

deny

the

value

of

some

of

the

work

done

by

the

manufacturing

chemists

some

synthetic

compounds

have

been

produced

by

chemical

processes

which

we

should

not

like

to

give

up

and

some

improved

forms

of

administering

the

older

remedies

are

due

at

least

in

part

to

their

ingenuity

nevertheless

let

any

one

not

accustomed

to

it

read

patiently

for

a

few

months

the

current

numbers

of

half

a

dozen

of

what

have

been

called

the

minor

medical

journals

or

let

a

careful

inspection

of

the

advertising

pages

of

the

major

journals

be

made

and

it

will

be

seen

that

large

classes

of

medical

menperhaps

a

majorityhave

been

completely

deceived

by

these

shrewd

fellows

they

have

reached

a

refinement

and

a

delicacy

in

their

commercialism

which

will

compare

favorably

with

the

court

intrigues

of

oriental

countries

every

prejudice

every

weakness

every

conceit

of

the

under

medical

world

is

played

upon

with

consummate

skill

and

with

amazing

success

take

for

instance

acetanilid

which

on

account

for

its

cheapness

has

been

made

to

enter

into

numberless

compounds

and

every

known

language

is

ransacked

in

the

search

after

new

compound

names

which

may

be

trade-marked

it

is

not

alone

the

laity

that

is

deceived

but

graduates

of

reputable

medical

schools

are

prescribing

and

indeed

dispensing

tons

of

this

stuff

and

often

without

knowing

its

composition

animal

extracts

for

thousands

of

years

animal

substances

of

various

degrees

of

nastiness

have

been

used

as

medicines

in

fact

some

of

the

darkest

chapters

of

human

history

are

those

relating

to

this

subject

sundry

cognate

superstitions

are

extant

to

this

day

even

among

the

nobility

of

civilized

countries

in

ancient

times

weird

ceremony

and

occultism

lent

their

charms

to

keep

up

interest

in

the

matter

while

in

these

scientific

times

the

influence

of

a

great

hyphenated

name

has

rekindled

a

fire

which

was

merely

flickering

and

which

seemed

to

be

in

danger

of

going

out

altogether

since

brown-sequard

made

himself

young

again

by

his

well

known

treatment

of

senility

great

attention

has

been

paid

to

the

subject

of

animal

extracts

from

every

corner

of

the

earth

have

come

workmensome

of

them

skilled

workmento

cultivate

this

promising

field

one

result

of

their

labor

is

a

mass

of

literature

which

contains

much

that

is

premature

much

that

is

fantastic

much

that

is

commercial

and

it

is

difficult

not

to

believe

that

some

of

it

is

closely

connected

with

unsoundness

of

mind

another

result

is

the

new

method

of

treating

myxedema

by

the

administration

of

thyroid

glandsraw

cooked

desiccated

or

in

the

form

of

extracts

recently

this

treatment

has

been

used

in

several

cases

with

marked

success

and

already

the

air

is

full

of

rumors

one

writer

said

a

few

months

ago

the

success

of

this

treatment

is

sure

to

create

a



in

animal

extracts

for

various

diseases

he

proved

to

be

a

true

prophet

and

we

are

in

the

midst

of

this



it

may

perhaps

be

open

to

question

whether

there

was

need

of

any

more

booms

we

have

had

booms

in

tuberculin

in

coal-tar

in

ovariotomy

if

not

in

common

sense

some

of

them

are

still

with

us

though

not

in

very

good

condition

after

the

boomers

and

the

seekers

after

notoriety

have

done

their

worst

with

animal

extracts

the

final

accounting

will

probably

show

some

increase

of

positive

knowledge

in

physiology

as

well

as

in

therapeutics

bacteriology

bacteriology

having

now

emerged

from

noisy

babyhood

into

promising

youth

it

may

not

be

amiss

to

ask

how

far

therapeutics

has

been

advanced

by

its

discoveries

and

what

the

outlook

is

for

the

future

it

has

been

alleged

by

some

clinicians

that

the

bacteriologists

have

been

a

little

dictatorial

and

have

carried

on

their

propaganda

somewhat

after

the

manner

of

the

salvation

army

be

that

as

it

may

the

amount

of

conscientious

and

unremunerated

work

which

has

been

devoted

to

the

subject

during

the

past

twelve

years

is

probably

beyond

the

power

of

conception

of

any

one

man

in

spite

of

numerous

mistakes

exaggerations

and

ludicrous

attempts

to

re-organize

therapeutics

the

bacteriologists

have

made

great

additions

to

our

knowledge

the

question

of

bacilliary

disease

is

however

enormously

complex

and

can

not

be

settled

by

a

few

cultures

and

a

few

hasty

deductions

points

that

were

supposed

to

be

settled

a

few

years

ago

are

now

under

discussion

again

and

with

regard

to

many

of

the

problems

it

is

still

impossible

to

say

just

where

the

truth

lies

many

thoughtful

men

have

lately

been

turning

their

eyes

from

the

microscope

toward

the

bedside

and

are

asking

themselves

whether

after

all

the

condition

of

the

soil

is

not

fully

as

important

as

the

germs

which

grow

there

and

they

are

consequently

spending

less

time

searching

after

germicides

one

eminent

physician

predicts

that

the

very

language

now

used

will

be

unintelligible

jargon

to

future

generations

of

germ

seekers

and

that

the

whole

subject

will

have

to

be

recast

whether

this

be

too

strong

language

or

not

it

is

doubtless

true

that

we

are

as

yet

only

on

the

threshold

of

this

department

of

science

and

that

exact

truth

can

be

established

only

by

a

closer

union

of

clinical

medicine

with

bacteriological

studies

the

success

of

modern

methods

of

preventing

disease

and

the

comparative

failure

of

antiseptic

and

germicidal

remedies

in

the

treatment

of

well

developed

disease

show

that

the

human

body

is

more

than

a

test-tube

even

though

numerous

theories

have

been

tested

therein

to

the

discomfiture

of

the

testers

creosote

creosote

still

refuses

to

move

on

into

obscurity

with

the

numerous

cures

consumption

which

have

recently

made

their

exit

from

the

therapeutic

stage

on

the

contrary

it

is

used

to

a

greater

extent

than

ever

before

and

the

testimony

as

to

its

value

gets

stronger

each

year

it

is

interesting

to

note

here

that

a

writer

who

is

by

many

regarded

as

the

leading

american

authority

on

therapeutics

feels

justified

in

ignoring

the

whole

matter

in

the

last

edition

of

his

work

recently

published

such

is

the

perversity

of

the

human

mindor

at

least

of

his

human

mind

in

giving

it

will

be

found

that

most

patients

take

it

in

the

form

of

sugar-coated

pills

more

readily

than

in

capsules

or

liquid

mixtures

this

statement

is

deliberately

made

after

thoroughly

trying

every

known

method

of

administration

in

a

large

number

of

cases

during

a

period

of

eight

years

patients

who

have

sensitive

stomachs

can

frequently

take

at

first

only

one

or

two

minims

per

day

but

by

slowly

and

carefully

increasing

the

dose

they

eventually

consume

twelve

to

fifteen

minims

each

day

without

suffering

from

gastric

irritation

the

success

of

the

creosote

treatment

is

seen

most

plainly

in

those

patients

who

have

taken

it

uninterruptedly

and

in

full

doses

for

several

years

many

of

these

people

improve

in

health

from

year

to

year

without

however

losing

their

symptoms

it

has

sometimes

been

claimed

by

metropolitan

physicians

that

the

rural

brethren

are

slow

to

avail

themselves

of

the

various

discoveries

in

medicine

and

surgery

and

that

they

go

on

very

much

as

their

grand

mothers

did

here

as

elsewhere

in

the

universe

there

are

compensations

your

country

doctor

can

now

look

back

a

little

and

with

regard

to

many

of

the

startling

advances

of

these

latter

years

he

can

see

that

the

advance

has

been

backward

and

he

is

not

quite

sorry

that

his

bucolic

inertia

has

kept

him

from

doing

urban

oophorectomy

upon

all

his

hysterical

female

acquaintances

on

other

occasions

he

accepts

the

dicta

of

the

medical

centers

with

alacrity

and

refuses

to

be

called

off

when

the

fashion

changes

this

was

seen

in

the

case

of

coal

tar

no

sooner

had

the

chemists

private

docents

assistant

physicians

and

royal

and

imperial

professors

of

germany

and

austria

announced

the

mighty

powers

of

antipyrine

than

he

began

to

employ

it

and

a

little

later

its

congeners

to

drive

fever

and

pain

out

of

the

world

in

many

a

remote

country

village

this

policy

is

still

followed

so

vigorously

that

fever

patients

are

kept

blue

and

sometimes

black

by

frequent

and

heroic

doses

of

coal

and

yet

the

great

majority

survive

in

of

no

peristalsis

at

least

where

the

balloon

is

when

the

drug

acts

on

the

small

intestine

the

peristalsis

occurs

early

and

when

on

the

large

intestine

late





force

of

the

peristalsis



this

can

be

measured

by

pulley

and

bag

of

shot

attached

to

the

graduated

tube

of

course

it

is

necessary

to

learn

first

the

lifting

power

of

the

peristalsis

in

the

same

dog

without

a

cathartic





injecting

a

solution

of

the

cathartic

into

a

ligatured

loop

of

intestine

in

the

living

animal



it

is

better

to

use

a

rabbit

or

dog

that

has

been

starved

for

several

days

so

that

the

intestine

will

be

empty

after

several

hours

remove

the

loop

and

measure

the

amount

of

liquid

if

it

is

increased

the

drug

stimulates

secretion

it

must

not

be

forgotten

that

the

irritation

of

the

ligature

stimulates

secretion

so

it

is

better

to

have

a

similar

loop

for

comparison





injecting

an

equal

quantity

of

water

in

two

similar

loops

of

intestine

in

the

living

animal

and

then

injecting

the

cathartic

into

one

of

them



use

a

starved

animal

after

several

hours

remove

the

loops

and

measure

the

quantity

of

water

in

each

if

the

one

containing

the

cathartic

has

not

diminished

as

much

as

the

other

then

it

diminishes

absorption

we

have

now

learned

how

to

determine

when

there

is

increased

peristalsis

and

where

it

is

when

there

is

increased

secretion

and

when

there

is

diminished

absorption

we

have

next

to

try

to

learn

the

exact

manner

in

which

these

are

produced

but

this

is

far

more

difficult



because

the

nervous

mechanism

of

the

intestines

is

very

complicated

and

at

present

not

very

much

of

its

physiology

is

known



because

instead

of

the

nerves

with

different

functions

having

a

separate

course

they

are

all

in

the

same

sheaths

so

that

one

kind

of

fibres

at

a

time

cannot

be

cut

the

vagus

contains

motor

inhibitory

motor

sensory

etc

fibres

so

that

when

one

is

cut

all

must

be

cut

the

same

is

true

of

the

splanchnic



because

if

a

drug

appears

in

the

urine

sweat

or

milk

it

is

no

proof

that

it

acts

in

the

circulation

for

it

may

act

locally

then

afterwards

be

absorbed

but

have

no

action

on

the

intestinal

mechanism



because

if

a

drug

cannot

be

found

in

the

urine

sweat

or

milk

it

is

not

proof

that

it

does

not

act

in

the

circulation

and

then

afterwards

be

entirely

excreted

by

the

intestinal

mucous

membrane

and

pass

out

with

the

feces

because

when

a

drug

given



purges

it

is

not

proof

that

the

drug

acts

as

a

cathartic

in

the

and

that

it

does

only

perhaps

as

good

a

way

as

any

to

proceed

unsatisfactory

is

first

to

exclude

the

then

this

is

shown

in

the

schematic

drawing

fig



in

which

for

simplicity

one

circle

represents

all

the

centres

in

that

location

it

must

not

be

forgotten

that

cutting

splanchnics

affects

the

intestinal

vessels

it

is

evident

that

after

cutting

the

vagi

and

splanchnics

the

cerebral

centres

can

have

no

influence

on

the

intestines

after

cutting

these

nerves

give

the

cathartic



if

it

does

not

act

as

a

cathartic

this

shows

that

it

acts

upon

the

intestines

entirely

through

the

cerebral

centres

which

now

have

no

influence

upon

the

intestines

this

action

is

probably

direct

and

not

reflex



if

it

acts

as

a

cathartic

equally

as

efficient

as

it

does

when

the

nerves

are

intact

this

shows

that

it

does

not

act

as

a

cathartic

through

the

cerebral

centres

the

action

is

either

on

some

of

the

abdominal

ganglia

on

the

local

intestinal

mechanism

illustration

if

it

acts

as

a

cathartic

but

much

weaker

than

when

the

nerves

are

intact

this

shows

that

it

acts

both

upon

the

cerebral

centres

and

also

on

some

part

of

the

remaining

mechanism

this

action

on

the

cerebral

centers

may

be

direct

or

it

may

be

reflex

from

irritation

of

the

intestinal

mucous

membrane

so

far

as

i

have

read

no

experiments

have

been

made

to

determine

when

the

action

is

direct

and

when

reflex

it

seems

probable

though

that

something

might

be

learned

about

it

in

the

following

way

which

is

illustrated

by

fig



select

two

similar

starved

animals

open

abdomens

of

both

and

expose

one

carotid

artery

in

one

of

them

inject

a

solution

of

the

cathartic

in

the

exposed

carotid

and

an

equal

solution

in

the

exposed

intestinal

loop

of

the

other

animal

place

animals

in

salt

solution

in

so

as

to

observe

through

incision

the

intestines



if

the

drug

acts

reflexly

by

irritation

of

the

intestinal

mucous

membrane

it

will

act

quicker

in

the

animal

in

which

the

drug

was

injected

into

the

intestinal

canal

see

fig



because

it

is

there

to

begin

action

at

once

while

in

the

other

it

must

first

be

excreted

into

the

intestinal

canal

the

intestine

can

be

observed

easily

in

the

salt

solution



if

the

drug

acts

directly

upon

the

cerebral

centres

it

will

act

quicker

in

the

animal

in

which

it

was

injected

into

carotid

artery

because

in

the

other

animal

it

has

to

be

absorbed

and

diffused

through

the

general

circulation

before

it

reaches

the

centre

clamping

the

aorta

would

make

this

more

accurate

were

it

not

that

the

are

so

easily

disturbed

the

this

is

not

very

satisfactory

because

the

vessels

are

greatly

dilated



if

the

peristalsis

this

on

on

places

this

may

be

direct

is

decided

that

the

acts

on

place

the

the

first

thing

is

to

find

out



whether

the

cathartic

acts

reflexly

by

the

irritation

of

the

mucous

membrane

being

transmitted

to

auerbachs

plexus

and

from

there

to

the

muscles

or



whether

it

acts

upon

some

structure

in

absorbed





it

acts

reflexly

it

will

act

quicker

when

injected

it

does

reflexly

it

will

act

quicker

when

where

in

cathartic

acts

the

points

are



stimulation

of

the

depression

of

the

inhibitory

motor

ganglia



stimulation

of

auerbachs

ganglia

and



stimulation

of

the

causes

tetanic

spasm

of

the

intestinal

muscles

which

is

not

affected

by

electrical

stimulation

of

the

this

shows

that

the

drug

acts

directly

on

the

muscles

in

this

way

it

can

be

shown

how

physostigmine

acts

if

the

drug

in

large

dose

increases

peristalsis

and

electrical

stimulation

of

inhibitory

motor

nerves

has

no

effect

upon

it

this

shows

that

the

drug

paralyzes

the

inhibitory

motor

nerves

it

can

be

shown

that

morphine

acts

in

this

way

in

fifteen

or

twenty

minutes

after

giving

a

dog

a

grain

of

morphine



it

usually

has

one

movement

a

nerves

if

the

of

in

cathartics

are

not

only

of

use

to

remove

feces

but

owing

to

the

physiological

relation

of

the

intestinal

tract

to

the

service

in

the

proper

cathartic

the

different

indications

cathartics

are

indicated





remove

dropsical

effusions



in

disease

of

the

liver

heart

kidneys

etc

there

are

sometimes

accumulations

of

serum

in

the

serous

cavities

and

subcutaneous

cellular

tissue

for

this

purpose

those

which

stimulate

secretion

and

cause

a

profuse

watery

discharge

are

best

suited

when

the

effusion

is

due

to

obstruction

in

the

liver

so

that

the

serum

leaks

from

the

congested

postal

vessels

they

are

most

prompt

in

action

because

they

drain

the

water

from

the

postal

vessels

and

lower

high

portal

pressure

magnesium

sulphate

elaterium

and

gamboge

are

efficient

here





remove

urea

etc

from

the

blood



sometimes

the

kidneys

are

so

diseased

that

they

cannot

excrete

the

waste

matter

from

the

body

and

its

action

when

abnormally

accumulated

causes

serious

symptoms

for

this

purpose

use

those

which

cause

watery

so

as

to

wash

the

out

through

this

channel

if

the

case

is

urgent

as

in

convulsions

croton

oil

is

the

best

to

use

because

it

can

be

dropped

on

tongue

and

does

not

have

to

be

swallowed

besides

acts

is

congestion

of

the

liver

and

enormous

quantities

of

bile

are

poured

into

the

intestine

chologogue

cathartics

are

needed

because

they

remove

all

this

bile

from

the

duodenum

and

give

the

over-active

liver

rest





deplete

the

mucous

membrane

in

gastro-
duodenitis



when

persons

of

a

certain

predisposition

over-eat

there

is

congestion

or

even

inflammation

of

the

gastro-
intestinal

mucous

membrane

this

extends

up

the

bile-duct

and

the

swelling

occludes

it

so

that

the

outflow

of

bile

is

obstructed

and

soon

it

diffuses

into

the

blood

and

the

person

becomes

jaundiced

the

salines

specially

sodium

salts

are

here

of

use

because

they

drain

away

the

water

without

stimulating

the

mucous

membrane

and

hence

lessen

the

hyperemia





stimulate

the

torpid

liver



this

is

not

in

biliousness

but

when

the

liver

does

not

secrete

bile

enough

the

patient

is

constipated

and

the

stools

are

too

light

from

lack

of

diarrhea

is

usually

caused

by

the

irritation

of

toxines

formed

by

the

growth

of

bacteria

the

intestinal

liquids

salines

are

best

to

to

select

those

cathartics

which

are

bactericides

so

as

to

kill

them

such

as

calomel

and

gray

powder





remove

this

is

probably

the

most

common

use

of

cathartics

those

which

in

be

guided

so

far

as

possible

by

local

conditions

the

trouble

may

be

in

we

must

decide

whether

the

the

take

his

at

afternoon

notice

carefully

the

who

pass

by

given

two

figures

after

first

represents

the

posture

of

the

illustration

he

will

find

that

about

seven

out

of

ten

of

the

women

who

pass

him

will

present

the

second

posture

in

addition

to

this

they

will

show

by

their

sallow

complexions

thin

flat

chests

angular

figures

and

miserable

gait

all

the

evidences

of

present

or

impending

ill-health

he

will

hardly

find

one

woman

out

of

ten

with

bright

eyes

a

clear

complexion

an

erect

carriage

and

a

firm

step

it

is

simply

impossible

for

human

beings

to

live

as

most

american

women

live

and

have

good

health

after

a

girl

puts

on

long

dresses

she

is

taught

that

almost

any

sort

of

active

bodily

movement

is

unladylike

her

frail

little

body

is

enveloped

in

corsets

which

effectually

prevents

the

full

development

of

the

important

trunk-muscles

at

school

she

gets

perhaps

a

little

make-belief

of

calisthenics

during

her

life

in

society

she

waltzes

with

great

ardor

it

is

true

and

it

is

said

that

to

go

through

all

the

evolutions

of

a

german

is

equivalent

to

a

walk

of

fifteen

miles

but

no

one

has

ever

seriously

claimed

that

this

form

of

exercise

is

conducive

to

health

after

marrying

the

american

woman

reduces

physical

exertion

to

the

minimum

any

form

of

physical

labor

is

regarded

by

her

as

menial

if

the

weather

is

bad

she

will

not

put

her

foot

out

of

the

house

for

whole

days

at

a

time

if

she

does

go

out

often

she

will

take

american

women

take

more

drugs

contributions

to

science

this

state

of

affairs

is

not

limited

to

any

particular

section

of

the

united

states

but

extends

from

maine

to

california

and

from

dan

even

unto

beersheba

it

is

national

in

its

scope

the

fact

is

that

ill-health

is

so

common

in

our

women

that

we

have

grown

accustomed

to

it

and

have

quite

unconsciously

set

up

a

low

standard

of

feminine

health

if

a

woman

is

habitually

constipated

dyspeptic

so

weak

that

she

can

hardly

walk

has

one

or

two

and

leucorrhea

capricious

appetite

and

a

moderate

degree

of

nervousness

and

insomnia

she

is

considered

to

possess

average

good

health

if

she

is

free

from

all

these

it

is

a

rare

exception

a

fortunate

accident

not

a

condition

of

health

to

be

attained

by

the

exercise

of

reason

and

common

sense

what

then

are

the

causes

for

ill-health

which

are

peculiar

to

american

women

these

may

be

divided

into

two

classes





the

unavoidable

and

the

avoidable

let

us

briefly

survey

the

unavoidable

causes

by

far

the

most

potent

of

these

is

our

climate

which

differs

from

that

of

europe

in

three

respects

it

is

more

variable

the

extremes

of

heat

and

cold

are

greater

and

the

atmosphere

is

drier

the

reason

for

the

extreme

variability

of

our

climate

is

found

in

the

fact

that

our

mountain

chains

run

north

and

south

while

those

of

europe

run

east

and

west

in

consequence

of

this

when

up

in

manitoba

territory

king

aeolus

reverses

his

spear

and

smites

upon

the

side

of

the

mountain

rude

boreas

comes

whistling

down

upon

us

with

hardly

a

moments

notice

except

a

hasty

telegram

from

washington

with

the

familiar

announcement

that

the

thermometer

will

fall

forty

degrees

in

the

next

twenty-four

hours

this

is

followed

by

nearly

as

rapid

a

rise

in

the

temperature

the

extremes

of

our

climate

keep

us

house-bound

for

a

large

part

of

the

year

and

this

is

a

very

potent

factor

of

ill-health

there

are

few

portions

of

the

country

where

it

is

agreeable

to

be

out

of

doors

for

as

many

as

a

hundred

days

of

the

year

the

effect

of

a

dry

variable

extreme

climate

is

to

stimulate

powerfully

the

nervous

system

and

keep

it

on

the





the

liberty

and

enlarged

scope

of

thought

and

action

which

american

women

enjoy

must

also

be

considered

as

causes

of

ill-health

how

much

more

nervous

energy

an

active

ambitious

american

woman

must

expend

than

a

german

matron

with

her

placid

narrow

life

there

are

many

other

unavoidable

causes

of

ill-health

in

american

women

which

need

not

be

discussed

here

let

us

rather

turn

our

attention

to

the

more

practical

consideration

of

the

avoidable

causes

of

ill-health

in

our

women

while

there

are

very

many

of

these

it

has

seemed

to

the

writer

that

the

following

are

the

principal

ones



lack

of

general

exercise



lack

of

specific

exercise



lack

of

abdominal

breathing



improper

modes

of

dress



superstition

as

every

one

is

aware

there

are

three

causes

for

the

circulation

of

the

blood



the

contraction

of

the

heart



contraction

of

the

voluntary

muscles



the

contraction

of

the

diaphragm

american

women

attempt

to

dispense

with

the

last

two

they

neither

take

exercise

nor

do

they

breathe

with

the

diaphragm

the

muscles

act

precisely

like

the

bulb

of

a

davidson

syringe

when

they

contract

the

blood

is

forced

into

the

veins

when

they

relax

a

new

supply

flows

in

dubois-reymond

determined

by

experiment

that

the

minimum

amount

of

exercise

necessary

to

maintain

the

circulation

is

equivalent

to

a

walk

of

five

miles

a

day

american

women

do

not

average

one-fifth

of

this

amount

the

diaphragm

acts

like

the

piston

of

a

great

pump

rising

and

falling

sixteen

times

a

minute

and

pumping

the

blood

out

of

the

abdominal

and

pelvic

cavities

where

its

stroke

is

only

one-half

or

one-third

the

normal

the

amount

of

blood

raised

must

be

correspondingly

less

the

investigations

of

dr

thos

j

mays

of

philadelphia

and

of

dr

j

h

kellogg

of

battle

creek

mich

have

shown

that

women

ought

to

breathe

precisely

as

men

do

the

thoracic

type

of

respiration

in

women

is

entirely

artificial

and

is

not

as

physiologists

have

claimed

a

wise

provision

of

nature

having

in

view

the

restriction

of

the

movements

of

the

diaphragm

during

pregnancy

the

second

cause

assigned

for

the

ill-health

of

american

women

is

lack

of

specific

exercise

all

exercise

is

not

of

equal

value

exercise

of

the

arms

and

legs

while

of

great

value

is

relatively

far

less

important

than

exercise

of

the

trunk

muscles

for

the

reason

that

the

circulation

through

the

thoracic

abdominal

and

pelvic

cavities

is

dependent

upon

exercise

of

the

muscles

surrounding

these

cavities

when

the

trunk

muscles

are

not

freely

and

systematically

exercised

the

circulation

through

the

lungs

and

through

the

abdominal

and

pelvic

organs

becomes

feeble

and

the

functions

of

these

organs

are

imperfectly

fulfilled

we

have

now

arrived

at

the

point

where

we

can

trace

step

by

step

the

evolution

of

ill-health

in

the

american

woman

her

undeveloped

body

is

encased

in

corsets

when

she

is

fifteen

years

old

at

school

she

learns

a

great

many

things

but

is

not

taught

that

in

order

to

have

good

health

she

must

exercise

the

muscles

of

her

body

and

especially

those

of

the

trunk

daily

and

systematically

after

marriage

she

settles

down

to

a

life

of

physical

inactivity

she

takes

hardly

any

exercise

and

even

this

little

is

not

taken

systematically

she

does

not

breathe

with

the

diaphragm

her

circulation

becomes

feeble

her

hands

and

feet

are

always

cold

the

blood

accumulates

in

her

abdominal

and

pelvic

cavities

the

functions

of

the

abdominal

and

pelvic

viscera

are

imperfectly

carried

on

she

becomes

dyspeptic

her

stomach

is

distended

with

gas

her

liver

and

intestines

are

torpid

the

waste

products

of

the

system

are

not

carried

off

but

accumulate

in

the

blood

the

opinion

is

constantly

gaining

ground

that

most

of

the

functional

nervous

disturbances

in

women

are

due

to

auto-
intoxication

by-and-by

the

pelvic

organs

begin

to

show

signs

of

disease

when

one

hears

of

the

daily

exploits

of

the

abdominal

surgeon

and

learns

that

there

is

hardly

one

woman

out

of

five

who

has

not

some

form

of

pelvic

disturbance

the

conviction

forces

itself

upon

the

mind

that

surely

our

women

must

be

grossly

violating

some

fundamental

law

of

health

we

have

traced

out

the

chain

of

physical

causes

which

lead

inevitably

to

a

stasis

in

the

abdominal

and

pelvic

circulation

as

a

further

result

of

this

stasis

there

occurs

a

sagging

of

the

abdominal

and

pelvic

viscera

and

as

the

latter

are

underneath

they

catch

the

worst

of

it

malpositions

of

the

uterus

are

produced

the

power

of

resistance

of

the

pelvic

tissues

to

invasion

by

pathogenic

microbes

is

lowered

the

tendency

to

plastic

exudations

is

increased

the

resolution

of

inflammatory

processes

is

very

much

retarded

and

thus

the

foundation

for

every

variety

of

pelvic

disease

is

laid

the

last

cause

assigned

for

ill-health

in

american

women

is

superstitionnot

religious

but

pharmaceutical

superstition

the

sublime

faith

with

which

an

american

woman

will

continue

to

swallow

nauseous

drugs

in

the

belief

that

they

will

restore

her

to

health

and

keep

her

in

health

is

only

equalled

by

her

faith

in

cosmetics

drugs

are

wonderful

things

in

their

place

but

it

is

not

possible

by

any

combination

of

drugs

to

replace

the

natural

processes

of

health

how

are

we

to

forestall

this

most

serious

of

all

our

national

evils

the

physical

degeneracy

of

american

women

this

matter

is

far

too

widespread

and

serious

to

be

rectified

by

a

little

anglomania

a

little

calisthenics

a

little

athletic

craze

there

are

far

too

many

women

who

lead

lives

that

can

only

be

characterized

as

parasitic

who

have

no

independent

existence

but

merely

cling

to

life

like

a

polyp

to

a

rock

they

generate

barely

enough

nervous

energy

to

eat

drink

sleep

dress

take

a

great

deal

of

medicine

complain

constantly

and

finally

drop

out

of

life

without

leaving

the

slightest

vacuum

the

only

way

to

meet

this

great

evil

is

to

introduce

physical

culture

into

our

schools

and

make

it

compulsory

not

until

then

will

our

women

realize

the

standard

of

feminine

health

as

laid

down

by

walt

whitman

they

are

not

one

jot

less

than

am

they

are

tanned

in

the

face

by

and

i

was

called

about

one

year

ago

to

mrs

mcg

age



found

she

had

just

miscarried

at

about

four

months

pregnancy

the

fetus

and

placenta

had

been

expelled

but

owing

to

inefficiency

of

uterine

contraction

there

was

profuse

hemorrhage

consequently

soon

after

my

arrival

i

found

i

had

to

contend

with

not

only

hemorrhage

but

a

grave

case

of

syncope

her

extremities

became

cold

and

the

heart-beat

was

scarcely

perceptible

and

surely

the

case

was

rapidly

becoming

one

of

heart-failure

quick

action

was

necessary

and

i

at

once

concluded

to

test

nux

vomica

and

proceeded

immediately

to

administer

one

drop

doses

of

the

tincture

every

five

minutes

when

the

sixth

dose

had

been

given

radial

pulse-wave

could

be

felt

and

the

heart-beat

distinctly

heard

five

more

doses

pulse

was

nearly

body

was

restored

and

was

on

contraction

and

i

succeeded

in

controlling

the

hemorrhage

in

a

few

hours

after

the

first

dose

of

nux

vomica

i

found

my

patient

in

such

a

comfortable

condition

of

reaction

that

i

left

for

home

about

six

months

afterward

i

was

called

in

the

early

part

of

the

evening

to

mrs

mcg

who

believed

she

was

again

pregnant

and

threatened

with

miscarriage

she

had

pain

in

the

back

and

profuse

hemorrhage

i

was

getting

good

control

of

the

hemorrhage

when

syncope

set

in

and

on

finding

it

was

becoming

protracted

and

her

condition

very

similar

to

that

for

which

i

had

used

the

nux

vomica

so

successfully

i

at

once

resorted

to

the

same

treatment

and

with

the

same

satisfactory

result

but

i

must

state

she

was

mistaken

as

to

pregnancy

in

the

course

of

that

night

she

passed

a

very

large

blood-clot

which

was

the

cause

of

her

trouble

it

evidently

had

been

accumulating

in

the

uterus

through

several

menstrual

periods

case

ii

in

the

fall

of



i

was

called

to

rose

l

colored

age



her

symptoms

at

first

were

of

indigestion

and

sluggish

liver

and

congested

portal

circulation

but

on

further

investigation

of

the

case

i

discovered

considerable

tenderness

over

the

left

ovary

on

the

third

day

of

my

attendance

contrary

to

my

advice

to

remain

in

bed

and

keep

quiet

feeling

quite

comfortable

in

the

afternoon

and

getting

permission

of

her

mother

she

left

her

bed

to

sit

in

an

adjoining

room

in

the

early

evening

of

that

day

i

was

sent

for

in

haste

to

see

rose

i

found

her

in

a

prolonged

state

of

syncope

and

her

mother

was

greatly

alarmed

fearful

she

would

die

the

patients

pulse

was

small

weak

and

frequent

and

counted



extremities

cold

she

was

in

a

semi-conscious

state

and

when

aroused

would

reply

in

a

whispering

voice

but

immediately

relapse

into

indifference

to

her

surroundings

it

seemed

to

approach

so

nearly

to

a

case

of

heart-failure

that

i

administered

nux

vomica

in

my

usual

way

as

to

dosage

and

intervals

resulting

within

an

hour

in

complete

restoration

of

pulse

warmth

of

body

and

consciousness

and

my

patient

became

quite

cheerful

and

talkative

case

iii

c

m

age



had

an

attack

of

acute

inflammatory

metastatic

rheumatism

in

the

third

week

of

the

attack

and

while

the

disease

was

yielding

to

treatment

he

was

attacked

with

an

exceedingly

troublesome

cough

but

as

he

had

been

confined

to

his

room

and

in

fact

to

the

bed

by

the

rheumatism

during

this

time

i

was

puzzled

to

account

for

the

cough

then

i

began

to

observe

more

closely

the

character

of

the

cough

and

expectoration

a

careful

auscultation

did

not

reveal

any

bronchial

inflammation

by

closely

questioning

the

patient

i

found

the

cough

was

paroxysmal

and

commenced

with

an

annoying

tickling

in

the

throat

the

cough

steadily

increased

in

violence

with

the

return

of

every

paroxysm

until

it

became

exhausting

and

the

patient

would

feel

quite

prostrated

after

each

attack

i

found

also

his

most

severe

paroxysms

came

on

within

ten

minutes

after

his

evening

meal

i

accordingly

timed

my

evening

visit

for

observation

i

was

now

satisfiedhaving

watched

a

paroxysm

from

beginning

to

end

which

lasted

over



minutesthat

the

cough

was

laryngeal

and

neurotic

on

examining

the

sputa

it

was

found

glairy

and

tenacious

and

not

such

as

we

find

in

inflammatory

conditions

of

mucous

membrane

of

the

air

passages

i

had

given

him

a

mixture

which

included

compound

tinct

benzoin

and

codeine

without

effect

but

now

being

convinced

the

affection

was

of

neurotic

origin

it

occurred

to

me

to

make

a

trial

of

tincture

nux

vomica

in

my

one-drop-five-
minutes-dosage

i

timed

my

call

the

next

evening

so

as

to

be

present

when

the

paroxysm

of

cough

commenced

my

patient

had

just

finished

his

evening

meal

and

we

had

been

conversing

hardly

ten

minutes

when

the

cough

set

in

and

rapidly

increased

in

violence

and

then

came

my

opportunity

for

the

crucial

trial

of

nux

vomica

in

this

case

when

i

had

given

the

seventh

one

drop

dose

the

paroxysm

began

to

yield

and

by

the

time

we

had

given

the

tenth

dose

it

was

almost

over

the

patient

having

an

occasional

cough

my

patient

was

very

happy

over

the

sudden

and

unexpected

relief

afforded

by

the

medicine

i

had

just

given

him

in

such

small

doses

and

of

course

was

curious

to

know

what

it

was

he

then

told

me

these

hard

paroxysms

sometimes

lasted

up

to

midnight

and

on

one

occasion

it

had

lasted

almost

until

morning

i

left

him

drops

to

take

in

the

night

in

case

he

should

have

another

paroxysm

when

i

reached

home

that

evening

i

do

not

think

my

patient

was

any

happier

than

i

was

over

my

success

with

the

nux

vomica

in

a

purely

experimental

case

the

next

morning

mr

m

informed

me

that

he

had

slept

through

nearly

the

entire

night

which

owing

to

the

cough

he

had

not

been

able

to

do

in

a

week

the

patient

from

that

night

had

no

return

of

severe

paroxysm

of

coughing

i

furnished

him

with

fresh

drops

every

day

and

he

became

so

well

posted

in

their

dosage

and

use

that

in

a

few

days

the

cure

of

the

cough

was

complete

and

i

may

here

add

that

i

have

had

several

similar

cases

of

cough

since

that

and

the

nux

vomica

has

succeeded

in

all

if

physicians

would

more

closely

diagnose

their

cases

of

cough

i

will

venture

to

say

there

might

be

discovered

more

than

one

case

of

neurotic

origin

laryngeal

case

iv

mrs

l

s

age



is

of

nervous

temperament

and

has

occasionally

attacks

of

a

mild

form

of

hysteria

about

one

month

ago

i

was

called

to

mrs

s

who

i

found

had

the

usual

symptoms

of

grippe

i

treated

her

accordingly

and

she

was

convalescing

nicely

i

had

made

my

morning

call

and

found

her

doing

fairly

wellexcepting

that

she

complained

of

a

slight

shortness

of

breath

i

carefully

examined

her

lungs

but

there

were

no

indications

of

pneumonia

in

the

afternoon

about



oclock

i

received

a

hurried

message

to

come

without

delay

to

see

mrs

s

i

found

her

in

a

very

nervous

somewhat

hysterical

and

desponding

condition

her

face

was

flushed

she

had

distressing

dyspnea

cardiac

palpitation

pulse



small

weak

and

frequent

which

of

course

was

due

to

the

functional

cardiac



being

no

indication

of

organic

disease

she

called

my

attention

particularly

to

her

difficult

breathing

so

soon

as

i

reached

her

bedside

and

begged

for

relief

i

took

in

the

situation

at

a

glance

and

wasted

no

time

in

thinking

of

a

remedy

to

meet

the

case

my

previous

experience

and

knowledge

of

the

efficacious

therapeutic

action

of

nux

vomica

in

neurotic

affections

prompted

its

immediate

use

in

this

case

the

fifth

one

drop-five-
minute

dose

reduced

the

pulse

to



and

in

a

measure

relieved

the

distressing

dyspnea

when

four

more

doses

had

been

given

the

pulse

dropped

to



and

the

dyspnea

was

so

nearly

conquered

that

the

patient

expressed

her

thankfulness

for

such

speedy

relief

after

a

steadily

increasing

suffering

of

over

four

hours

by

the

time

four

more

doses

had

been

taken

respiration

was

normal

and

the

pulse



my

medical

mission

was

accomplished

and

i

left

my

patientwho

was

now

feeling

very

comfortablewith

instructions

to

continue

the

one-drop

doses

every

half

hour

for

four

more

doses

and

then

every

hour

up

to

bedtime

next

morning

she

was

sitting

up

in

her

bed

feeling

quite

comfortable

with

respiration

normal

and

pulse



the

palpitation

having

entirely

subsided

she

has

had

no

further

trouble

up

to

date

case

v

about

two

weeks

after

the

occurrence

of

this

last

i

was

called

to

mrs

e

c

age



i

found

her

suffering

from

great

dyspnea

and

palpitation

she

was

also

greatly

troubled

with

flatulent

dyspepsia

and

frequent

eructations

the

difficulty

of

breathing

and

the

palpitation

of

the

heart

had

been

increasing

for

several

hours

and

as

it

was

a

new

experience

in

her

life

she

and

her

husband

became

greatly

alarmed

lest

the

attack

should

prove

fatal

but

i

knew

my

patient

as

she

had

been

one

of

my

clientele

for

many

years

i

knew

she

was

of

nervous

temperament

and

slightly

hysterical

i

wasted

no

time

but

administered

tinct

nux

vomica

according

to

my

usual

plan

the

particulars

in

this

case

would

only

be

a

repetition

of

others

and

it

is

unnecessary

to

recite

them

the

is

looked

upon

as

strictly

a

affair

only

two

ways

of

treatment

being

thought

of



e



reduction

by

or

in

of

failureand

if

the

patient

and

family

will

consent

the

knife

the

former

usually

fails

and

consent

to

the

latter

is

frequently

so

long

deferred

that

the

result

is

anything

but

satisfactory

hence

any

measure

which

is

at

the

same

time

simple

and

helpful

should

be

looked

upon

as

a

valuable

acquisition

the

plan

of

treatment

which

i

wish

to

present

will

best

be

understood

if

illustrated

by

the

record

of

a

case

in

hand

one

morning

recently

i

was

summoned

hurriedly

to

see

an

elderly

german

laborer

whose

breach

was

down

so

the

messenger

said

and

it

surely

was

such

a

scrotal

display

i

never

saw

before

a

mass

larger

than

a

childs

head

and

as

hard

and

tense

as

a

foot-ball

i

thought

at

first

that

part

of

it

must

be

an

old

hydrocele

but

was

assured

by

the

sufferer

that

him

all

goes

back

this

rupture

was

of

some

ten

years

standing

formerly

the

hernia

was

retained

with

a

truss

but

of

late

years

it

had

been

allowed

to

go

up

and

down

according

to

circumstances

never

having

become

strangulated

before

now

my

experience

has

been

that

when

an

old

man

who

has

had

years

of

practice

reducing

his

hernia

fails

to

put

it

back

the

surgeon

has

a

job

on

his

hands

in

this

particular

case

most

of

the

mass

was

resonant

but

there

was

a

lump

the

size

of

a

goose-egg

close

to

the

ring

that

was

hard

and

gave

a

perfectly

flat

precussion

notethe



by

strangulation

the

very

irritation

from

which

caused

a

tighter

spasm

of

the

muscle-fibres

between

which

the

mass

protruded

i

tried

taxis

faithfully

so

had

the

old

man

and

we

both

failed

i

used

hot

fomentations

to

no

avail

i

placed

him

at

an

incline

of



and

sprayed

the

mass

with

cold

water

to

stimulate

contraction

of

the

muscles

of

the

cord

they

contracted

sharply

but

had

no

effect

except

to

increase

his

pain

i

lowered

him

to

the

horizontal

position

covered

him

up

with

a

hot

blanket

and

sat

down

to

rest

here

was

an

old

man

hernia

strangulated

for

some

two

or

three

hours

a

serious

case

it

was

growing

worse

every

moment

and

nothing

seemed

likely

to

avail

but

the

knife

the

spasm

was

intense

how

could

i

relax

it

i

hesitated

to

try

an

anesthetic

for

various

reasons

one

of

which

was

that



found

a

piece

of

candle

burning

in

a

beer

mug

at

the

feet

of

my



knowing

the

great

value

of

hyosciamine

in

spasm

of

the

viscera

i

took

from

my

ever-present

alkaloidal

granule-case

hyosciamine

amorphous

gr



and

gave

it



with

morphine

sulphate

gr



and

atropine

gr



in

a

few

moments

my

patient

said

thats

better

and

in

less

than

ten

minutes

a

gurgling

of

gas

was

heard

through

the

mass

indicating

relaxation

of

spasm

thus

encouraged

i

gave

a

second

dose

adding

to

hyosciamine

gr



strychnine

arseniate

gr



the

latter

to

induce

forced

peristalsis

in

less

than

ten

minutes

more

i

heard

a

loud

gurgling

sound

and

my

patient

cried

hims

gone

and

sure

enough

it

had

the

entire

mass

had

disappeared

through

a

hole

the

size

of

a

nickel

a

retentive

bandage

for

the

time

and

a

well

fitted

truss

a

few

days

after

completed

the

treatment

me

recently

i

have

had

an

opportunity

of

proving

the

efficacy

of

this

new

solvent

and

am

much

pleased

with

the

result

obtained

during

the

months

of

august

and

september

i

had

five

children

under

my

care

suffering

from

diphtheria

as

all

the

children

belonged

to

one

institution

had

the

same

nurse

and

in

every

way

the

same

surroundings

i

had

a

good

opportunity

of

testing

the

solvent

powers

of

this

drug

as

compared

with

others

in

the

first

child

age



years

i

used

acetic

acid

spray

as

a

solvent

giving

iron

and

potassium

chlorate

internally

although

the

membranes

in

fauces

visibly

shrank

the

disease

extended

downwards

rapidly

almost

choking

the

patient

intubation

was

resorted

to

which

for

a

time

relieved

the

choking

symptoms

but

the

child

gradually

sank

two

more

children

were

seized

with

the

disease

and

the

fauces

were

painted

with

sulpho-calcine

a

remedy

i

have

used

successfully

for

some

years

and

corrosive

sublimate

was

given

internally

the

children

improved

but

the

patches

were

a

long

time

in

shrinking

i

applied

an

aqueous

solution

of

methylene

blue





to

the

patches

by

means

of

a

camels-hair

brush

three

times

a

day

the

effect

was

remarkable

not

only

did

the

patches

after

the

third

application

shrink

but

the

feverishness

and

restlessness

abated

three

days

after

the

commencement

of

the

treatment

all

the

patches

in

both

children

had

disappeared

two

more

children

aged



years

and



years

were

attacked

as

the

patches

covered

the

uvula

tonsils

and

back

of

the

pharynx

and

no

further

down

i

thought

that

i

would

try

local

treatment

only

after

a

few

days

the

patches

disappeared

the

fever

left

and

the

children

were

convalescent

piperazin

and

piperazin

hydrochlorate

i

have

of

late

had

ample

opportunity

to

test

both

piperazin

and

piperazin

hydrochlorate

as

solvents

of

uric

acid

hitherto

i

have

used

the

salts

of

lithium

and

potassium

in

the

uric

acid

diathesis

but

will

now

certainly

always

use

the

new

solvent

in

preference

to

either

of

these

i

have

taken

particular

pains

to

watch

the

action

of

the

drugso

feel

confident

in

stating

that

it

is

the

best

of

known

uric

acid

solvents

i

have

never

noticed

any

toxic

effects

from

the

use

of

either

preparation

but

prefer

the

hydrochlorate

on

account

of

being

less

hygroscopic

although

i

believe

piperazin

can

now

be

procured

in

lozenge-form

in

glass

tubes

which

greatly

lessens

the

hygroscopicity

i

will

now

briefly

give

particulars

of

three

cases

of

uric-acid

diathesis

treated

with

the

medicine

the

first

a

man

aged



weight

nearly

three

hundred

pounds

suffered

much

renal

pain

with

occasional

symptoms

of

small

calculi

passing

along

ureter

the

urine

had

very

acid

reaction

the

microscope

revealed

numerous

crystals

the

murexide

test

likewise

proved

that

uric

acid

was

present

in

abundance

this

patient

wishing

to

become

thin

was

put

on

a

beef

diet

no

potatoes

few

vegetables

etc

just

the

diet

to

increase

the

uric

acid

he

was

put

on

the

solvent

treatment

giving

twelve

grains

divided

into

three

doses

daily

each

dose

was

given

in

a

tumblerful

of

vichy

water

in

a

few

days

the

urine

became

neutral

in

reaction

the

loin-pains

left

also

the

constant

desire

to

micturate

caused

by

the

irritation

of

the

uric

acid

the

beef-treatment

was

kept

up

for

several

weeks

and

the

weight

was

reduced

by



pounds

this

case

shows

that

although

no

precautions

were

taken

to

diminish

the

formation

of

uric

acid

but

the

contrary

piperazin

was

sufficient

to

dissolve

the

crystals

the

second

case

was

that

of

a

man

aged



weight



pounds

he

complained

of

pain

described

as

burning

in

loins

also

a

dull

ache

in

bladder

frequent

desire

to

micturate

sometimes

urine

was

mixed

with

blood

without

altering

the

diet

at

all

which

was

always

a

liberal

one

including

beer

every

day

all

the

disagreeable

symptoms

disappeared

while

taking

piperazin

hydrochlorate

on

several

occasions

there

was

a

return

in

a

modified

form

of

the

symptoms

but

after

a

few

doses

of

the

drug

they

always

disappeared

the

third

case

was

that

of

a

man



years

of

age

who

had

for

years

felt

pain

in

kidneys

along

ureter

and

in

bladder

and

never

got

much

relief

i

prescribed

for

him



grains

of

piperazin

to

be

taken

three

times

daily

in

large

quantities

of

water

after

a

weeks

treatment

the

pains

had

left

and

he

was

better

than

he

had

been

for

years

has

used

it

and

its

treatment



the

manifestations

of

influenza

in

this

section

of

the

country

during

the

past

two

months

have

been

numerous

and

varied

although

the

malady

has

been

far

less

directly

fatal

than

on

its

first

appearance

in

the

winter

of



the

different

types

of

the

disease

the

pulmonary

the

nervous

and

the

abdominal

have

been

less

distinctly

marked

but

it

has

been

especially

severe

in

the

case

of

elderly

people

when

appearing

as

an

intercurrent

affection

another

noticeable

feature

is

that

the

disease

has

shown

a

greater

disposition

to

attack

children

than

in

former

years

although

when

children

have

been

enjoying

usually

good

health

fatal

results

have

been

rare

this

however

has

not

been

the

case

with

sickly

or

puny

children

as

the

disease

has

manifested

itself

in

various

ways

such

as

throat

ear

and

other

complications

in

many

cases

nothing

more

than

the

peculiar

pains

characteristic

of

the

disease

have

been

noticed

in

others

it

has

passed

off

with

nothing

more

serious

than

would

result

from

a

bad

cold

so

that

large

numbers

have

fought

it

out

on

this

line

the

prevalence

of

the

malady

in

the

vicinity

of

philadelphia

and

we

presume

this

observation

holds

good

elsewhere

has

been

wide

spread

showing

conclusively

that

it

is

largely

dependent

upon

atmospheric

influences

indeed

up

to

the

present

writing

the

condition

of

the

weather

has

been

extremely

favorable

to

the

development

of

influenza

and

we

all

hope

that

better

weather

during

the

remainder

of

the

winter

will

tend

to

check

its

spread

judging

from

published

reports

the

treatment

of

influenza

during

the

present

epidemic

has

been

mainly

symptomatic

simple

remedies

being

employed

in

place

of

the

powerful

antipyretics

and

analgesics

that

were

so

extensively

used

three

years

ago

and

this

may

account

in

part

for

the

reduced

mortality

in

this

connection

the

writer

ventures

to

suggest

the

use

of

a

limited

number

of

remedies

that

have

proven

of

signal

service

within

the

past

two

months

in

the

pulmonary

type

to

relieve

the

distressing

and

frequent

cough

nothing

has

given

better

results

than

morphine

hydrochlorate

and

pilocarpine

hydrochlorate

given

hourly

in

doses

of

one-fiftieth

of

a

grain

each

together

this

combination

seems

to

allay

sufficiently

extraneous

irritation

while

it

favors

the

re-
establishment

of

the

normal

secretions

and

has

shown

remarkably

favorable

effects

when

broncho-
pneumonia

threatened

to

supervene

given

in

these

small

doses

it

produces

neither

narcotism

nor

depression

and

the

patient

is

ready

to

take

his

regular

meals

to

which

is

added

liquid

nourishment

during

the

intervals

hot

milknot

boiledand

the

free

use

of

beef-tea

made

from

a

good

extract

of

beef

are

helpful

in

assisting

to

maintain

the

strength

in

the

abdominal

type

with

much

pain

along

with

mucous

discharges

from

the

bowels

showing

involvement

of

the

liver

a

combination

of

mercury

biniodide

with

codeine

sulphate

appears

to

control

and

modify

the

progress

of

the

disease

one

one-hundredth

grain

of

the

former

with

one-tenth

to

one-fifth

grain

of

the

latter

may

be

administered

every

two

hours

and

along

with

this

where

we

have

to

contend

with

the

pains

peculiar

to



and

neuralgicit

is

well

to

administer

conjointly

small

doses

of

bryonia

from

two

to

five

drops

of

the

tincture

can

be

given

at

intervals

of

two

to

four

hours

cases

which

do

not

respond

readily

to

bryonia

will

often

quickly

show

amenability

to

the

administration

of

rhus

toxicodendron

given

in

one-drop

doses

of

the

green

root

tincture

at

intervals

of

two

hours

it

is

remarkable

what

power

these

two

simple

remedies

exercise

over

the

fugitive

neuralgic

pains

peculiar

to

influenza

doubtless

because

they

modify

the

nutrition

of

the

cells

composing

the

fibrous

structures

enabling

them

to

throw

off

waste

products

and

thus

maintain

a

condition

approaching

that

of

health

the

after-treatment

will

embrace

the

administration

of

the

arseniates

of

iron

and

strychnine

and

in

debilitated

subjects

this

should

be

supplemented

by

the

exhibition

of

cod-liver

oil

or

petroleum

in

the

form

of

emulsion

it

will

be

noted

that

nothing

has

been

said

in

regard

to

the

advisability

of

antiseptics

and

for

this

reason





that

although

the

disease

may

apparently

be

associated

with

a

micro-organism

this

microbe

plays

no

important

part

in

the

various

manifestations

of

the

disease

whatever

influence

it

may

possess

is

as

we

have

seen

from

clinical

experience

counteracted

discounted

by

what

the

older

physicians

were

pleased

to

term

the



medicatrix



and

besides

we

have

absolutely

nothing

to

warrant

us

in

assuming

that

our

present

antiseptic

measures

and

remedies

exercise

any

perceptible

influence

when

taken

into

the

system

at

least

so

far

as

regards

this

particular

malady

further

investigations

in

this

line

may

develop

some

new

ideas

in

this

respect

but

for

the

present

we

must

rest

content

with

the

stern

facts

as

we

see

them

at

the

bedside

special

attention

should

be

directed

here

to

the

theory

of





as

elaborated

by

professor

chittenden

published

in

another

department

of

this

number


-infection

in

abdominal

disorders



in

view

of

the

complications

arising

in

the

course

of

abdominal

diseases

from

auto-infection

and

with

our

recent

knowledge

in

regard

to

this

important

but

insidious

factor

it

behooves

the

physician

to

be

on

the

look-out

for

such

manifestations

toxic

anemia

as

portrayed

by

dr

john

e

bacon

in

our

last

number

brings

to

light

some

valuable

truths

which

should

ever

be

uppermost

in

the

minds

of

those

having

to

deal

with

occult

affections

considering

that

we

now

have

ample

evidence

that

a

sick

person

may

be

his

own

worst

enemy

by

reason

of

an

unhealthy

condition

of

the

alimentary

canal

it

is

not

too

much

to

assume

that

in

many

cases

of

prolonged

illness

the

complications

arising

may

frequently

be

due

to

auto-infection

and

thus

in

addition

to

the

disease

which

is

seen

there

is

another

disease

engrafted

upon

the

first

which

is

insidious

but

persistent

the

plan

of

using

purgatives

to

unload

the

intestinal

tract

and

relieve

the

portal

circulation

has

its

value

but

the

habit

once

established

cannot

be

relieved

permanently

by

this

method

the

addition

of

antiseptics

is

likewise

a

valuable

feature

in

the

treatment

of

this

class

of

cases

and

the

two

combined

will

often

serve

a

useful

purpose

but

cases

occur

in

which

either

method

alone

or

both

combined

fail

and

it

is

then

that

we

are

compelled

to

study

the

philosophy

of

cell-function

in

this

connection

the

studies

of

pohl

as

elaborated

by

chittenden

promise

to

shed

a

flood

of

light

upon

the

vexed

and

complicated

problem

which

involves

the

theory

of

nutrition

if

digestive

leucocytosis

as

delineated

by

these

authors

be

true

and

we

have

no

reason

to

doubt

their

conclusions

then

we

have

a

satisfactory

explanation

of

the

value

of

proper

food

for

the

sick

to

say

nothing

of

the

nutrition

of

those

who

ordinarily

enjoy

good

health

the

fact

being

admitted

that

white

blood-
corpuscles

or

leucocytes

are

more

rapidly

developed

after

the

ingestion

of

food

it

follows

that

this

cellular

activity

was

intended

to

accomplish

or

aid

in

accomplishing

certain

metabolic

changes

and

when

to

this

fact

we

add

the

knowledge

advanced

by

metschnikoff

concerning

the

function

of

phagocytes

which

are

said

to

be

modified

white

blood-
corpuscles

together

with

the

scientific

demonstrations

of

vaughan

that

these

cells

produce

through

the

activity

of

their

nucleus

an

antiseptic

substance

we

have

a

complete

scientific

explanation

of

the

need

for

suitable

food

stuffs

not

only

in

illness

of

every

description

but

also

as

a

precautionary

measure

against

disease

it

is

time

that

the

study

of

the

class

of

cases

under

consideration

should

be

placed

on

a

scientific

basis

in

order

that

we

may

have

some

definite

idea

of

the

objects

to

be

attainedand

the

method

of

attaining

themexpressed

in

terms

which

may

be

comprehended

by

the

merest

tyro

in

and

to

this

end

the

contributions

of

metschnikoff

pohl

chittenden

and

vaughan

must

be

accepted

as

valuable

preliminary

data

the

next

thing

in

order

will

be

to

make

these

scientific

facts

clinical

facts

by

making

them

practical

and

it

is

therefore

necessary

that

others

should

take

up

task

in

that

the

work

may

be

carried

a

successful

principle

involved

in

the

subcutaneous

use

of

blood-serum



an

important

revelation

has

been

made

to

the

medical

profession

in

the

form

of

a

communication

to

the





jan





by

dr

c

f

darnall

of

llano

texas

according

to

the

report

twins

suffered

from

ptomain-
poisoning

and

one

of

them

died

the

surviving

child

was

treated

by

the

subcutaneous

employment

of

a

normal

salt

solution

but

without

apparent

benefit

later

this

was

followed

by

the

use

of

two

ounces

of

blood-serum

drawn

from

the

arm

of

the

father

a

healthy

young

man

to

quote

the

words

of

the

author

the

child

was

carefully

watched

and

reaction

occurred

in

about

six

hours

improvement

gradually

took

place

and

in

six

days

upon

a

diet

of

thin

corn-meal

gruel

at

first

later

by

fresh

milk

prepared

the

child

was

well

it

was

placed

at

the

mothers

breast

at

regular

intervals

and

at

the

time

of

writing

nearly

nine

weeks

after

the

onset

of

the

illness

of

the

children

the

lacteal

secretion

is

fully

established

now

this

is

evidently

a

very

interesting

case

and

all

physicians

who

wish

to

understand

the

whys

and

wherefores

would

like

to

have

some

additional

light

thrown

upon

this

occult

subject

in

this

instance

there

is

no

intimation

that

the

father

had

been

previously

rendered

immune

to

the

peculiar

ptomain

which

in

this

case

is

supposed

to

have

been

derived

from

a

can

of

condensed

milk

how

then

could

this

blood-serum

have

exerted

a

favorable

change

in

the

metabolism

of

the

infant

which

was

but

ten

weeks

old

our

bacteriological

friends

will

tell

us

that

the

benefits

were

due

to

the



antiseptic



of

normal

blood-serum

but

the

clinician

and

intelligent

and

conscientious

physician

will

want

to

know

from

whence

this

peculiar

property

is

derived

the

blood

is

an

alkaline

fluid

and

we

are

taught

that

antiseptic

solutions

to

be

effective

must

be

acid

how

does

it

happen

therefore

that

blood-serum

obtained

from

normal

blood

which

is

alkaline

possesses

antiseptic

properties

this

question

has

already

taken

up

so

much

space

in

the

journal

that

aside

from

our

prospective

subscribers

it

would

not

be

advisable

to

take

further

time

for

its

elucidation

it

will

be

sufficient

however

to

say

that

it

involves

a

principle

first

developed

from

a

scientific

standpoint

by

professor

vaughan

who

has

shown

conclusively

that

the

antiseptic

property

of

blood-serum

is

due

to

the

fact

that

the

nucleus

of

the

white

corpuscles

secretes

an

actively

antiseptic

substance

a

substance

having

all

the

characteristic

of

a

proteid

which

he

has

denominated



at

the

risk

of

becoming

monotonous

in

furthering

this

measure

we

repeat

that

nuclein

solutions

may

be

obtained

from

yeast-cells

from

the

yelk

of

the

egg

from

the

thyroid

gland

from

the

spleen

and

from

other

organs

of

the

body

and

when

properly

prepared

they

are

as

powerful

in

modifying

the

multiplication

of

microorganisms

as

is

corrosive

sublimate

or

any

other

recognized

bactericide

the

principle

underlying

the

subcutaneous

use

of

blood-serum

is

therefore

demonstrable

and

is

strictly

within

the

confines

of

scientific

medicine

how

long

it

will

require

to

educate

the

medical

profession

in

this

knowledge

remains

to

be

seen

but

if

it

was

merely

an

empirical

claim

or

chimerical

fancy

and

backed

by

sufficient

capital

or

government

patronage

the

period

would

be

short

from

m

d

of

to

the

editor

calling

attention

to

the

dose

of

santonin

used

as

an

emmenagogue

which

i

had

reported

in

the

american

therapist

vol

i

no



p



july



dr

murkon

asks

whether

the

dose

as

given

is

not

a

misprint

if

not

it

is

certainly

more

than

dangerous

as

five

grains

has

caused

a

fatal

result

i

wish

to

say

that

in

the

year

and

a

half

since

the

article

in

question

was

written

i

have

often

made

use

of


-


doses

of

santonin

for

its

emmenagogue

effects

and

in

no

instance

have

i

learned

of

the

slightest

discomfort

from

such

a

dose

i

rarely

administer

more

than

a

single

dose

but

if

more

are

required

i

invariably

wait

twenty-four

hours

before

giving

them

the

dose

is

always

administered

at

night

on

retiring

and

at

the

same

time

i

order

a

mustard

foot-bath

and

frequently

hot

drinks





i

would

say

again

that

i

have

never

seen

this

procedure

lead

to

any

untoward

effects

or

even

any

discomfort

and

usually

the

menstruation

is

comfortably

and

apparently

normally

established

by

the

next

day

i

do

not

believe

it

is

possible

to

produce

miscarriage

or

abortion

by

this

treatment

i

have

never

seen

it

follow

and

so

certain

am

i

of

this

fact

that

i

have

come

to

look

upon

it

as

being

a

safe

and

convenient

means

in

making

a

differential

diagnosis

as

to

the

presence

or

absence

of

conception

in

cases

of

suppressed

menses

i

am

so

confident

of

this

diagnostic

value

that

i

am

in

the

habit

of

saying

to

the

patient

when

there

is

any

doubt

as

to

the

cause

of

the

suppression

i

shall

give

you

a

dose

of

medicine

which

will

bring

matters

around

all

right

if

you

have

taken

a

cold

but

if

there

is

a

natural

cause

for

the

arrest

of

the

menstruation

you

need

look

for

no

results

who

has

not

occasion

frequently

to

decide

for

the

anxious

patient

the



of

delayed

menstruation

they

come

to

you

insisting

that

the

suppression

is

not

due

to

conception

and

are

exceedingly

importunate

in

their

demands

for

relief

here

then

is

a

medium

through

which

i

have

frequently

solved

this

perplexing

question

and

through

which

i

have

been

enabled

to

conscientiously



for

such

cases

while

otherwise

i

should

have

refused

to

use

any

means

to

afford

relief

advising

number

i

contributed

a

short

account

of

a

long

violent

and

refractory

exacerbation

of

bronchial

which

yielded

almost

instantly

to

the

to

seemed

to

me

to

be

a

convulsion

so

to

speak

of

the

afferent

freezing

dr

henry

p

loomis

states



rec



that

he

has

found

quite

a

number

of

cases

of

recovery

from

phthisis

his

summary

is

as

follows



out

of



persons

dying

of

a

non-tubercular

disease

seventy-one

or

over

nine

per

cent

at

some

time

in

their

life

had

phthisis

from

which

they

had

recovered



the

new

fibrous

tissue

by

which

the

advance

of

the

disease

was

apparently

checked

and

the

cure

effected

developed

principally

by

round-cell

infiltration

of

the

interlobular

connective

tissue

which

in

some

instances

had

increased

to

an

enormous

extent

some

of

the

new

fibrous

tissue

was

formed

later

by

round-cell

infiltration

in

the

alveolar

walls

and

around

the

blood-vessels

and

bronchi

pleuritic

fibrosis

appears

to

be

secondary

to

tubercular

processes

the

interlobular

primary

and

present

in

out

of

of

these

healed

areas

did

not

in

their

gross

or

microscopical

appearances

from

those

in

which

they

were

not

found



thirty-six

per

of

dr

spaeth

of

hamburg

according

to

the



has

now

published

reports

of

twenty-five

cases

in

which

he

has

performed

the

operation

known

as

ventro-fixation

of

the

uterus

none

of

the

cases

proved

fatal

in

seventeen

permanent

anteflexion

was

obtained

in

fourteen

there

was

besides

the

retroflexion

a

diseased

condition

of

the

uterine

appendages

necessitating

their

removal

of

the

cases

that

were

not

so

complicated

all

except

one

were

successful

dr

spaeth

rarely

fastens

the

stump

of

the

broad

ligament

into

the

abdominal

wound

usually

stitching

the

fundus

uteri

directly

to

the

parietal

peritoneum

in

the

later

cases

he

adopted

schedes

methodthat

is

to

say

silver

sutures

were

drawn

through

the

whole

thickness

of

the

abdominal

walls

at

intervals

of

about

an

inch

and

a

half

but

they

were

not

at

first

tied

in

the

intervals

finer

silver

sutures

were

inserted

through

the

sheaths

of

the

recti

the

peritoneum

and

the

fundus

uteri

and

tightened

twisted

and

cut

short

the

whole

of

course

being

beneath

the

skin

the

thicker

sutures

were

then

tightened

and

twisted

and

the

lips

of

the

wound

brought

together

with

superficial

catgut

sutures

the

subcutaneous

silver

sutures

remained

but

never

gave

any

trouble

dr

schede

and

dr

spaeth

are

both

of

opinion

that

this

method

is

the

best

for

preventing

any

hernia

and

that

when

it

has

been

employed

abdominal

binders

are

unnecessary

dr

spaeth

does

not

perform

or

recommend

ventro-fixation

in

cases

of

retroflexion

unless

there

is

either

disease

of

the

appendages

or

chronic

peritonitis





croupous

pneumonia

has

during

recent

times

been

defined

as

an

infectious

disease

characterized

by

inflammation

of

the

lungs

and

constitutional

disturbance

of

varying

intensity

the

recognition

of

an

infection

as

a

cause

of

this

disease

necessarily

implies

the

existence

of

a

specific

germ

and

as

corollary

we

may

state

that

this

germ

like

all

germs

has

a

limited

existence

during

the

cause

of

the

inflammation

three

stages

have

been



red

hepatization

and

gray

hepatization

now

on

a

physician

being

called

to

a

case

of

this

kind

the

query

is

what

is

the

best

thing

to

do

in

the

way

of

medical

treatment

if

one

consults

some

of

his

associates

he

will

find

remedies

recommended





one

declares

the

fever

does

no

harm

while

another

is

not

satisfied

unless

one

of

the

chemical

antipyretics

keeps

the

temperature

near

the

normal

standard

varying

results

of

course

follow

these

different

treatments

having

for

a

long

time

accepted

and

practised

the

doctrine

that

many

diseases

can

be

modified

and

conducted

to

a

safe

issue

by

giving

a

remedy

that

will

attack

the

diseased

cell-function

i

have

treated

my

cases

of

pneumonia

in

this

way

the

three

remedies

that

i

employ

are

aconite

bryonia

and

iodine

if

i

am

called

to

see

a

patient

during

the

first

stage

i

give

aconite

and

iodide

of

potassium

and

on

the

development

of

the

second

stage

i

continue

the

iodide

and

also

give

bryonia

the

aconite

is

given

with

a

view

of

relieving

the

vaso-motor

tension

and

thereby

equalizing

the

circulation

this

if

doing

nothing

more

produces

a

measure

of

comfort

the

last

two

remedies

are

given

for

their

local

effect

now

as

to

a

dose

in

a

half

goblet

of

water

i

put

ten

drops

of

tincture

of

aconite

and

in

another

goblet

containing

same

quantity

of

water

i

put

five

grains

of

iodide

of

potassium

and

give

a

teaspoonful

alternately

every

hour

as

soon

as

the

second

stage

comes

on

i

substitute

five

drops

of

tincture

of

bryonia

for

the

aconite

and

continue

to

give

in

alternation

with

the

iodide

if

the

heart

becomes

weak

give

one-fourth

of

a

grain

of

extract

of

nux

vomica

every

three

or

four

hours

if

the

patient

has

much

pain

hot

applications

are

used

this

with

suitable

food

constitutes

a

treatment

that

bears

excellent

results

the

physician

who

believes

in

giving

large

doses

of

quinine

ammonia

etc

will

sneer

at

these

small

doses

and

hotly

declare

that

nature

cures

independently

of

the

drugs

in

view

of

this

declaration

there

is

a

compliment

paid

to



medicatrix



that

the

writer

recognizes

and

to

have

such

an

ally

is

certainly

a

desirable

help

those

who

have

faith

in

heroic

dosage

are

not

always

mindful

of

this

fact

nor

yet

of

the

condition

which

obtains

under

their

hands

and

that

is

a

state

of

disturbance

such

of

that

it

is

impossible

for

the

medical

man

in

ordinary

practice

to

keep

pace

with

it

we

have

ptomaines

and

leucomaines

and

in

the

literature

of

the

journals

these

two

terms

are

used



which

is

unfortunate

as

tending

to

create

confusion

while

ptomaines

are

those

alkaloidal

products

of

metabolism

belonging

to

the

cadaver

or

to

any

dead

organism

whether

animal

or

vegetable

the

term

is

now

applied

to

the

same

products

in

living

tissues

and

which

really

are

not

ptomaines

but

leucomaines

chemically

speaking

both

ptomaines

and

leucomaines

exist

in

the

forms

of

monamines

diamines

and

triamines

and

have

hitherto

been

regarded

as

resulting

from

the

oxidation

of

ammonium

salts

by

abstraction

of

water

or

from

acids

by

substitution

of

amidogen

yet

the

bacteriologists

assure

us

that

they

are

the

secretions

or

rather

excretions

of

bacteria

just

in

the

same

way

that

the

strata

of

non-igneous

rocks

of

the

earth

are

formed

primarily

by

the

secretion

and

secondarily

by

the

excretion

of

calcareous

shells

of

diatoms

or

of

the

cretaceous

shells

of

those

protozoans

entitled

rhizapods

elsewhere

in

the

summary

i

have

expressed

myself

to

this

effect

in

nearly

the

same

language

and

while

it

may

seem

pedantic

it

should

be

borne

in

mind

that

this

is

the

age

of

terminology

we

each

of

us

have

our

special

tiesshall

i

say

hobbies

one

of

us

making

the

eye

a

specially

will

make

use

of



terms

another

turns

his

attention

to

the

technology

of

animal

tissues

and

still

another

with

an

eye

towards

the

bacteriological

existences

leads

us

into

a

labyrinth

of

greek

and

latin

technics

we

are

talking

of

ptomaines

and

leucomaines

and

that

their

existence

is

probably

due

to

bacteria

these

are

regarded

as

toxines

and

certain

diseases

are

said

to

be

caused

by

these

toxines

and

not

from

the

bacteria

themselves

directly

but

indirectly

i

appreciate

the

idea

that

the

curative

results

of

these

diseases

are

due

to

the

antagonism

of

the

remedies

to

these

toxines

and

not

to

the

destruction

of

the

bacteria

before

we

inquire

into

the

curative

action

of

remedies

we

must

first

find

out

how

these

toxines

produce

disease

the

tendency

is

to

trace

the

origin

of

all

disease

to

a

change

in

the

protoplasmic

cells

this

change

is

evidently

due

to

a

toxine

a

healthy

physiological

change

in

the

cells

may

be

termed

metabolism

while

an

unhealthy

or

pathological

change

may

be

termed

katabolism

the

question

arises

in

what

way

does

katabolism

arise

from

these

toxines

it

occurs

to

me

that

it

must

be

due

to

chemical

affinity

or

as

it

is

sometimes

very

properly

called



in

a

brief

but

very

excellent

article

on

therapeutic

action

by

dr

thomas

j

mays

of

philadelphia

in

the

american

therapist

he

commences

thus

every

phenomenon

in

nature

becomes

intelligible

only

when

considered

in

the

light

of

force

any

scientific

system

of

therapeutics

must

therefore

be

built

on

a

broader

basis

than

that

of

the

mere

drug

action

on

the

animal

economy

in

this

he

is

unquestionably

correct

but

when

he

along

with

others

asserts

that

drug

action

is

due

to

what

is

termed

interference

to

me

at

least

he

becomes

unintelligible

i

am

utterly

unable

to

take

in

the

idea

when

he

refers

it

to

molecular

motion

in

permit

to

make

the

following

quotation

from

the





of

course

it

had

been

recognized

that

certain

diseases

are

self-limited

and

the

phenomena

of

natural

and

acquired

immunity

were

duly

appreciated

but

it

required

the

knowledge

gained

by

the

advances

in

bacteriology

to

afford

a

rational

explanation

of

these

phenomena

there

is

yet

much

to

learn

the

beginning

has

but

been

made

enough

however

has

been

seen

to

teach

that

disease

has

its

chemistry

and

that

the

treatment

of

the

future

will

depend

upon

a

knowledge

of

this

fact

and

the

application

of

chemic

laws

the

progressive

physician

does

not

believe

that

it

is

true

he

uses

the

word

just

as

we

say

the

sun

rises

and

sets

when

we

know

that

it

does

neither

the

one

or

the

other

but

that

the

phenomena

are

due

to

the

revolution

of

the

earth

on

its

axis

the

function

is

the

you

may

call

it

or

anabolism

it

is

either

a

or

a

process

now

derange

the

by

of

and

you

have

what

may

be

called

katabolism

the

the

the

function

a

the

leucocytosis



many

investigators

seeking

after

an

explanation

of

the

methods

by

which

nutritive

material

is

carried

from

the

alimentary

tract

to

the

different

tissues

and

organs

of

the

body

have

called

attention

to

the

possible

importance

of

the

white

corpuscles

in

the

assimilation

of

food-stuffs

citing

the

fact

that

in

a

well

nourished

carnivorous

animal

there

is

a

marked

production

of

new

cells

in

the

lymph

spaces

of

the

intestinal

mucous

membrane

after

the

ingestion

of

food

the

extent

of

said

production

being

apparently

dependent

upon

the

amount

of

assimilable

elements

contained

in

the

food

it

has

been

further

supposed

that

this

increased

production

of

lymph

cells

is

followed

by

a

corresponding

increase

in

the

passage

of

leucocytes

into

the

blood

mainly

on

the

ground

that

only

a

comparatively

few

of

the

cells

could

have

any

local

action

in

aiding

the

nutrition

of

the

intestinal

walls

there

has

been

however

a

lack

of

positive

proof

of

these

assumptions

until

pohl



in

his

studies

on

the

absorption

and

assimilation

of

food-stuffs

took

up

the

matter

experimentally

and

sought

to

obtain

some

positive

data

bearing

on

the

question

this

investigator

made

a

careful

study

of

the

physiological

variations

in

the

content

of

leucocytes

in

dogs

blood

using

young

animals

and

feeding

them

only

one

meal

a

day

the

leucocytes

were

counted

after

thomas

method

preliminary

experiments

showing

that

there

was

very

little

difference

in

the

number

of

white

cells

contained

in

a

given

volume

of

arterial

or

venous

blood

thus

in

the

case

of

a

fasting

animal

blood

taken

from

the

jugular

vein

contained





white

corpuscles

per

cubic

millimeter

while

blood

from

the

carotid

artery

of

the

same

side

contained





white

cells

per

cubic

millimeter

further

from

a

well-fed

animal

whose

blood

was

examined

during

digestion

similar

results

were

obtained



e







from

the

jugular

vein

and





from

the

carotid

thus

showing

that

blood

from

the

capillaries

of

either

veins

or

arteries

would

give

essentially

the

same

results

a

single

experiment

illustrative

of

the

many

reported

by

pohl

may

about

thirty

distinct

experiments

were

tried

on

ten

different

animals

with

only

two

or

three

negative

results

to

fifty

positive

ones

the

results

taken

collectively

plainly

indicate

that

the

increase

in

the

number

of

leucocytes

in

the

circulating

blood

after

the

ingestion

of

food

is

very

marked

the

maximal

increase

being



per

while

the

average

increase

amounted

to



per

cent

this

as

pohl

states

would

indicate

for

the

total

content

of

blood

in

an

animal

an

increase

in

some

cases

of









of

control

experiments

showed

that

normally

there

were

only

comparatively

small

variations

in

the

content

of

leucocytes

in

the

blood

from

hour

to

hour

in

the

absence

of

food

it

is

to

be

further

observed

that

this

marked

increase

in

the

number

of

white

corpuscles

in

the

circulating

blood

after

the

ingestion

of

food

usually

reaches

its

maximum

in

the

third

hour





at

a

time

when

digestion

would

most

probably

have

reached

its

height

no

noticeable

change

being

usually

observed

before

the

end

of

the

first

hour

after

the

taking

of

food

evidently

some

transformation-
products

of

the

ingested

food

must

be

formed

before

leucocytosis

becomes

marked

the

return

to

the

normal

number

of

leucocytes

shows

no

regularity

in

some

cases

being

very

gradual

in

others

quite

rapid

this

marked

action

of

food

in

increasing

the

number

of

leucocytes

in

the

circulating

blood

naturally

raises

the

question

whether

all

varieties

of

food

possess

this

power

or

whether

it

is

limited

to

some

one

or

more

individual

food-stuffs

in

attempting

to

answer

this

question

pohl

tried

a

large

number

of

experiments

the

results

of

which

afforded

proof

that

neither

water

salts

fats

carbohydrates

or

even

meat

extracts

are

able

to

materially

affect

the

number

of

leucocytes

in

the

blood

proteid-
containing

foods

on

the

other

hand

such

as

meat

wittes

peptone

and

gelatin

peptone

quickly

raise

the

content

of

white

blood

corpuscles

to

a

marked

degree

somewhat

noticeable

was

the

result

obtained

on

feeding

wheat

bread

this

food-stuff

in

spite

of

its

fairly

large

content

of

proteid

matter

failed

to

exert

any

influence

on

the

number

of

leucocytes

in

the

blood

and

in

conformity

with

this

result

it

was

found

that

in

herbivorous

animals

there

was

an

utter

lack

of

anything

approaching

a

digestive

leucocytosis

even

after

protracted

fasting

in

attempting

to

explain

the

cause

of

this

increase

in

the

number

of

leucocytes

in

the

circulating

blood

after

the

ingestion

of

proteid

food

we

are

at

once

confronted

with

the

possibility

of

this

apparent

increase

being

relative

rather

than

absolute

as

possibly

due

to

a

loss

of

water

from

the

blood

incidental

to

the

marked

outpouring

of

digestive

juices

accompanying

digestive

proteolosis

for

this

view

however

there

is

very

little

support

in

the

first

place

the

blood

would

need

to

become

very

much

thickened

by

loss

of

water

to

account

for

the

increased

number

of

leucocytes

observed

in

the

experiments

furthermore

we

know

that

the

outpouring

of

watery

secretions

into

the

intestine

during

digestion

is

accompanied

by

an

absorptive

current

in

the

opposite

direction

which

would

tend

to

counteract

any

tendency

towards

concentration

of

the

blood

and

indeed

might

lead

in

many

cases

to

a

direct

dilution

of

this

fluid

again

if

the

increase

in

the

number

of

white

corpuscles

is

to

be

explained

in

this

manner

there

should

be

a

corresponding

increase

in

the

number

of

red

blood

corpuscles

as

a

matter

of

fact

pohls

results

show

that

those

conditions

of

diet

tending

to

increase

the

number

of

white

blood

corpuscles

are

without

any

noticeable

effect

on

the

red

corpuscles

abstraction

of

water

can

not

therefore

be

the

cause

of

the

large

number

of

leucocytes

contained

in

the

blood

after

a

proteid

diet

much

more

plausible

is

the

view

that

the

increase

is

due

to

a

more

rapid

transference

of

the

corpuscles

from

their

point

of

origin





from

the

intestine

and

from

the

lymph

glands

of

the

mesentery

to

the

blood

in

other

words

it

seems

probable

that

digestive

proteolysis

in

the

stomach

and

intestine

is

followed

or

accompanied

by

a

rapid

production

of

new

cells

in

the

lymph

spaces

surrounding

the

intestine

if

this

view

is

correct

there

should

be

a

much

larger

number

of

leucocytes

in

the

blood

and

lymph

flowing

from

the

intestine

in

an

animal

in

full

digestion

than

in

the

arterial

blood

coming

to

the

intestinal

tract

that

such

is

the

case

is

shown

by

the

following

experiment

taken

from

the

many

reported

by

pohl

weighing

the

facts

would

thus

seem

to

warrant

the

assertion

that

as

a

rule

the

venous

blood

flowing

from

the

intestinal

tract

of

an

animal

fed

on

a

rich

proteid

diet

contains

a

much

larger

number

of

leucocytes

than

the

arterial

blood

flowing

to

the

intestine

although

if

space

permitted

we

might

instance

certain

occasional

exceptions

due

to

various

causes

which

however

do

not

reflect

against

the

view

that

there

is

a

marked

production

of

leucocytes

in

the

lymph

spaces

surrounding

the

intestine

and

in

the

lymph

glands

of

the

mesentery

as

a

normal

accompaniment

to

digestive

proteolysis

taking

into

account

all

of

the

circumstances

attending

the

circulation

of

the

blood

through

the

abdominal

organs

especially

the

rate

of

flow

and

remembering

the

great

increase

in

the

number

of

leucocytes

contained

in

the

blood

during

the

several

hours

attending

digestive

proteolysis

it

is

plain

that

a

comparatively

large

amount

of

proteid

matter

must

be

transferred

from

the

intestine

to

the

blood

in

the

bodies

of

the

white

corpuscles

so

abundantly

produced

in

the

lymph

glands

etc

during

proteid

digestion

indeed

pohl

calculates

on

the

basis

of

his

own

and

the

observations

of

others

that

in

the

case

of

an

animal

weighing



kilograms

and

fed

with



grams

of

fresh

beef

containing



grams

of

proteid

matter

the

entire

amount

of

albumin

required

to

supply

the

loss

incidental

to

the

normal

physiological

processes

of

the

body

could

be

absorbed

into

the

circulation

from

the

intestine

in

the

form

of

leucocytes

assuming

a

digestive

period

of

six

hours

moreover

the

evidence

acquired

from

pohls

experiments

of

the

enormous

production

of

new

cells

in

the

intestinal

walls

during

the

height

of

digestion

renders

such

a

theory

of

the

transference

of

proteid

matter

from

the

alimentary

tract

to

the

tissues

and

fluids

of

the

body

quite

plausible

at

the

end

of

twenty-four

hours

the

leucocytes

have

fallen

back

to

their

normal

number

having

presumably

been

broken

down

in

the

blood-plasma

or

dissolved

in

the

tissues

and

organs

thus

giving

up

the

proteid

matter

of

which

they

are

composed

for

the

general

nourishment

of

the

body

obviously

we

can

not

admit

that

all

the

proteid

matter

of

the

food

is

absorbed

in

the

form

of

leucocytes

for

as

we

know

some

at

least

of

the

proteid

food

ingested

is

carried

beyond

the

peptone

stage

either

through

the

action

of

trypsin

or

through

the

action

of

the

organized

germs

in

the

intestine

but

we

can

certainly

accept

the

views

so

admirably

worked

out

by

pohl

in

so

far

as

they

indicate

one

way

in

which

proteid

matter

may

pass

from

the

intestine

into

the

blood

after

having

undergone

a

preliminary

transformation

in

the

alimentary

tract

into

primary

albumoses

and

peptone

again

if

pohls

views

are

correct

we

see

that

the

proteid

foods

are

quickly

transformed

into

organized

material

in

the

body

of

the

lymph

cell

prior

to

their

absorption

into

the

blood

a

view

which

is

in

harmony

with

the

long-known

fact

that

peptone

and

other

products

of

digestion

can

not

be

detected

in

any

quantity

at

least

in

the

blood

of

the

portal

vein

even

after

the

ingestion

of

a

diet

rich

in

proteids

as

has

been

frequently

stated

in

the

past

the

products

of

proteolytic

action

are

transformed

in

the

very

act

of

absorption

presumably

through

the

activity

of

the

epithelial

cells

of

the

villi

and

we

may

now

assume

in

the

light

of

pohls

results

that

this

transformation

may

be

due

in

part

at

least

to

the

upbuilding

of

the

ordinary

products

of

digestion

into

the

living

protoplasm

of

the

white

corpuscles

in

the

intestinal

walls

the

it

is

at

the

most

of

all

of

prepared

exclusively

by

american

it

will

naturally

receive

a

a

examination

shows

that

it

what

it

claims

to

be

namely

a

written

by

practical

who

are

owing

to

this

special

it

entitled

to

more

than

attention

at

the

hands

of

physicians

but

this

characteristic

will

give

it

standing

and

doubtless

will

be

the

means

in

all

this

point

it

will

be

in

and

is

intended

as

its

title

implies

to

be

a

for

physicians

and

a

line

of

treatment

has

been

laid

down

in

every

case

and

although

no

attempt

has

been

made

to

discuss

mooted

points

still

the

most

important

of

these

have

been

noted

recommended

are

described

in

text

under

eye

and

cannot

fail

to

grasp

the

idea

it

is

to

be

regretted

that

the

authors

names

do

not

appear

in

connection

with

their

respective

contributions

and

this

is

about

the

only

feature

that

will

detract

from

the

completeness

of

the

work

for

example

we

should

like

to

know

which

one

of

the

ten

is

responsible

for

the

statement

found

on

page



to

the

effect

that



salts

of

potassium

in

full

doses

are

cardiac

depressants



this

is

true

only

in

part

as

it

is

a

well-recognized

fact

that

when

eliminatives

are

required

iodides

are

valuable

in

fact

are

demanded

and

when

given

in

what

is

known

as

medicinal

doses

potassium

iodide

is

an

efficient

cardiac

stimulant

it

is

not

however

a

cardiac

stimulant

in

the

sense

that

digitalis

strychnine

and

arsenic

are

cardiac

stimulants

through

their

influence

upon

the

cardiac

mechanism

but

rather

because

potassium

iodide

increases

protoplasmic

activity

promoting

the

discharge

of

waste

products

and

thus

lessens

materially

the

work

devolving

upon

the

heart

muscle

itself

statements

of

this

character

should

always

be

made

with

caution

since

they

are

too

sweeping

and

calculated

to

mislead

those

unfamiliar

with

the

true

physiological

action

of

drugs

fluids

with

meals

the

arguments

presented

by

many

writers

seem

to

prove

that

the

moderate

taking

of

fluids

with

the

food

at

meals

is

not

without

benefit

but

the

importance

of

the

thorough

mastication

of

food

before

it

is

presented

to

the

stomach

must

never

be

overlooked

if

this

is

interfered

with

in

any

way

by

the

use

of

liquids

we

must

promptly

prohibit

their

indulgence

fluids

may

be

taken

ad

libitum

during

meals

by

those

whose

digestive

powers

will

allow

it

but

such

persons

should

keep

in

mind

that

the

strongest

stomach

may

be

abused

too

far

while

those

whose

stomachs

are

already

unequal

to

a

severe

strain

should

be

especially

careful

as

to

the

quantity

of

fluid

imbibed

with

the

food

the

saliva

is

the

best

lubricator

for

the

food

while

it

is

in

the

mouth

both

because

of

its

starch-
digesting

powers

and

because

its

alkalinity

serves

to

stimulate

a

copious

flow

of

the

acid

secretion

of

the

stomach

any

habit

therefore

which

permits

the

entrance

of

food

into

the

stomach

before

it

is

thoroughly

incorporated

with

saliva

must

be

pronounced

pernicious

in

the

extreme

if

we

cannot

afford

the

time

necessary

for

masticating

our

food

properly

and

incorporating

it

thoroughly

with

saliva

it

would

be

better

to

take

nothing

but

broths

and

similar

foods

the

use

of

water

and

other

liquids

as

lubricators

is

not

to

be

tolerated

on

the

other

hand

if

we

bear

in

mind

the

whole

mechanism

of

digestion

it

will

readily

be

seen

that

in

cases

of

weakness

or

want

of

tone

on

the

part

of

the

muscles

of

the

stomach

when

every

part

of

the

food

cannot

be

properly

presented

to

the

action

of

the

digestive

juices

the

introduction

into

the

stomach

of

a

moderate

amount

of

water

may

be

of

no

slight

benefit

the

mass

of

food

will

become

more

pliable

and

so

more

easily

operated

upon

by

the

weakened

protection

against

diphtheria

the

board

of

health

has

announced

a

new

measure

looking

to

the

control

and

diminution

of

diphtheria

and

circulars

were

sent

to

practising

physicians

giving

the

grounds

for

the

step

decided

upon

and

the

reasons

why

it

was

deemed

expedient

the

proposition

is

to

supplement

the

primary

bacteriological

examination

now

made

at

the

beginning

of

any

individual

case

of

the

disease

by

other

cultures

repeated

during

its

course

and

during

convalescence

it

is

hoped

in

this

way

to

make

sure

that

apparent

recovery

and

the

disappearance

of

all

false

membrane

is

followed

by

the

extermination

of

all

the

loeffler

bacilli

from

the

throat

the

circular

is

written

by

dr

hermann

m

biggs

chief

inspector

of

pathology

bacteriology

and

disinfection

and

is

signed

by

president

wilson

with

the

approval

of

the

board

it

is

explained

that



cases

of

true

diphtheria

have

been

subjected

to

repeated

examinations

at

intervals

of

three

or

four

days

during

illness

and

until

the

disappearance

of

the

bacilli

it

was

found

that

in



cases

the

bacilli

persisted

after

the

complete

separation

of

the

false

membrane

or

in

other

words

after

the

individual

had

recovered

of

these



cases



showed

the

germ

for

seven

days

thirty-four

for

twelve

days

sixteen

for

fifteen

days

four

for

three

weeks

and

in

three

for

five

weeks

after

the

exudation

had

completely

disappeared

from

the

upper

air-passages

the

circular

infers

thence

that

these

results

show

that

in

a

considerable

proportion

of

cases

persons

who

have

had

diphtheria

continue

to

carry

the

germs

of

the

disease

in

their

throats

for

many

days

after

all

signs

and

symptoms

of

the

disease

have

disappeared

these

experiments

have

led

the

health

department

to

adopt

the

rule

that

no

person

who

has

suffered

from

diphtheria

shall

be

considered

free

from

contagion

until

it

has

been

shown

by

bacteriological

examination

made

after

the

disappearance

of

the

membrane

from

the

throat

that

the

throat

secretions

no

longer

contain

the

diphtheria

bacilli

and

that

until

such

examinations

have

shown

such

absence

all

cases

in

boarding-houses

hotels

and

tenement-houses

must

remain

isolated

and

under

observation

disinfection

of

the

premises

therefore

will

not

be

performed

by

the

department

until

examination

has

shown

the

absence

of

the

organisms

secondary

cultures

as

in

the

case

of

primary

cultures

may

be

made

by

the

attending

physician

if

he

so

desires

otherwise

they

will

be

made

by

the

inspector

of

the

district

in

which

the

case

occurs

this

applies

only

to

cases

occurring

in

boarding-houses

hotels

and
